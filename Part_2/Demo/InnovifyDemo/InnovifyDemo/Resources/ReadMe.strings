//Case Study Title:

//As a vehicle owner, I should be able to track my vehicle's location after a fixed time interval so that I am aware of my vehicle's location.

//Description: -
//Need to design a screen with on/off button to start/stop location tracking.
//- Location should be captured after every 30 seconds interval, if speed >= 80
//- Location should be captured after every minute if speed < 80 and speed >= 60
//- Location should be captured after every 2 minutes if speed < 60 and speed >= 30
//- Location should be captured after every 5 minutes if speed < 30 Captured location should be saved as file in SD card with format as follows;
//- Time Latitude Longitude Current time interval(in seconds), Next time interval(in seconds) ex. 22/04/17-11:00:00:100 23.0 72.40 30 60 Also captured location should be saved in SQLite database
//
//Scenario: - If vehicle speed goes down suddenly then it should decrease time interval gradually (i.e 30 seconds > 1 minutes > 2 minutes > 5 minutes) Ex. If the vehicle is moving with speed at 90km/h and suddenly it stops with speed at 20km/h then time interval should not decrease from 30 seconds to 5 minutes but instead, it should calculate next time interval to be 1 minute.
//
//Expected Output: Working iOS project source code, Unit test cases, unit test result, Database design document, Flow chart for given problem
